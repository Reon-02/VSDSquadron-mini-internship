## INSTRUCTOR:Kunal Gosh
## Objectives
### 1:To write a C program to calculate the sum of numbers and to verify it using appropriate commands.
### 2:Compile the same code using the RISC-V compiler to generate its assembly code. Then, evaluate the RISC-V assembly code for the sample C program by using two different compilation options.
## Project Setup
- Install virtualbox
- Launch the Virual box
- Create a new Virtual Machine
- Select Linux as the operating system and under version choose Ubuntu 18.04
- Attach th VDI files to the machine
